        <p>1.Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators</p> 
        <pre>
            both are comparison operators.
            == compares only
            ===compares the value and the datatype.
                
            eg: let a=2;
                let b="2";
            console.log(a==b);//true
            console.log(a===b);//false
            a=2 is a number. b="2" is a string.
            so a==b checks the value only return true.
            a=== checks the value and the datatype then it returns false.
        </pre>
        <p>2.What is the spread operator?</p>
        <pre>
            It is new additional operator in ES6.
            basically it used to return shadow copy of the js object.
            (...) is used for spread operator.
            it takes in an iterable (array) and expand it into individual elements.
            let a=[1,2,3,4];
            let b=[...a];
            console.log(b);//[1,2,3,4]

            let c=["h","e","y"];
            let d=[...c];
            console.log(d);
        </pre>
        <p>3.What are the differences between var, let and const?</p>
        <pre>
            var: Functional scope (or) global scope
            var only supports hoisted.
            it can be reinitalized and redeclared.
            and cand be modified later.

            let: Block scope
            let not supports hoisted.it returns undefined
            it cannot be reassign or redeclared.
            it cannot be modified later.
            
            const: Block scope.
            const not supports hoised.it returns undefined.
            it cannot be reassign or redeclared.
            it cannot be modified later.
        </pre>
        <p>4.What is execution context</p>
        <pre>
            Browser's javascript engine create a special environment to handle the transformation and 
        its exection of the code. this environment known as Execution function. 
        exection context contains that currently code running and everything that aid in its execution.
        <!-- During the Execution context running specific  code will be parsed by the parser, and converted into 
        machine-level code,and create a memory for its execution.
        two type of context. -->
        two type of execution context in js:
        <ol type="1">
            global execution context
            functional exection context
        </ol>
        In global exection context variable are stored in the memory.two phases will be executed.
        <ol type="1">
            creation phase
            execution phase.
        </ol>
        In the creation phase variables are name as undefined.after the creation phase global execution
        moved to execution phase.
        During the execution phase js engine executes line by line, assign the values to the variable.
        similar to function execution context.
        </pre>
        <p>5.What is meant by first class functions</p>
        <div>
            First class function are  the function that passed as an arguments into another function or 
            can be  return from another funtion called first class citizes.
